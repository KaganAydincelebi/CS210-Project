# Motivation
I am a FIDE Master (FM) chess player, and this project allows me to analyze my own chess game history and gain insights into my performance. By leveraging data science techniques, I aim to uncover patterns, strengths, and areas of improvement in my gameplay.

# Dataset
- **Source**: My personal game history from Lichess.
- **Details**:
  - Game IDs
  - Player ratings (mine and opponents')
  - Move sequences
  - Game results (win, loss, draw)
  - Timestamps and durations
  - Opening names and ECO codes
- **Collection Method**: Data will be retrieved programmatically using the Lichess API through the Python Berserk library and Lichess application as a text file

# Project Idea
Through this project, I aim to answer various questions and explore insights about my chess performance, including:
- How do I perform against top-rated players in the world?
- Which openings work best for me across different Elo intervals?
- What openings have the highest win rate for me?
- Do I perform better with White pieces or Black pieces?
- How does my performance vary across time controls (e.g., bullet, blitz, rapid)?
- What is my average game length, and how does it affect my results?
- How do my results compare when playing classical openings versus modern or unconventional ones?
- Are there patterns in my wins or losses against specific player styles (e.g., aggressive, positional)?
- Which opponents do I struggle against the most, and what strategies might help improve?
- What is my performance trend over timeâ€”am I improving, plateauing, or declining?

# Plan
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use Berserk to retrieve my Lichess game data.
   - Filter and clean the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summarize data using descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize trends in performance, openings, and opponent ratings.

3. **Insight Generation**:
   - Identify openings with the highest success rates.
   - Analyze performance trends based on color (White/Black) and Elo intervals.
   - Evaluate game phases to identify strengths and weaknesses.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Create graphs and charts to present findings (e.g., win rates per opening, performance over time).

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**:
   - Summarize key findings.
   - Propose strategies for improvement based on analysis.

# Tools
We will use the following tools and libraries to accomplish the goals of this project:
- **Google Colab**: For collaborative coding and analysis.
- **Berserk**: A Python library for accessing the Lichess API.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations to understand performance trends.
- **Seaborn**: For more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (via Google Colab): For interactive analysis and sharing progress.
