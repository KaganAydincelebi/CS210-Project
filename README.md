My CS210 Data Science Project
**1. Motivation**
I am a FIDE Master (FM) chess player, and this project allows me to analyze my own chess game history and gain insights into my performance. By leveraging data science techniques, I aim to uncover patterns, strengths, and areas of improvement in my gameplay.
